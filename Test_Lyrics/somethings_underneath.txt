[Intro]
Raise up out the dirt
And the rain beat down, down, down
And the sun beat down, down, down
And the beat in the ground, ground, ground
Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Massacre in the making
There's not a place you can take it
Breaking the face of a planet
Waiting for something to shake
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down (Shake it down)
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down (Shake it down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down, then raise up, how high?

[Verse 2]
Broken middle finger pointed right up to the sky
Broken fist and hammer hangin' right up in the light
Waiting patient for the signal when the time is right
To bring it down (They ain't ready for it), shh
Bring it down, bring it down, bring it down (Bring it down)
Swing it down, swing it down, swing it down (Swing it down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down, then raise up

[Verse 3]
Birds free, words hang like neck on tree
Or more like secret on country
Au contraire, more like skin on teeth
Thin veil don't tell what it don't see
Many mini things are multiplying at the bottom
Where the base of everything is from (Hot)
Hit the core, work on the floor
Don't stop 'til they're strong enough to hold the hordes (Oh, God)
Air is heavy, you wet, the sweat drown, drown, drown (Drown)
Nobody better make a sound, sound, sound (Shh)
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down, then raise up

[Chorus]
Something is underneath, the weight's off
Birds in the trees don't sing
As if the mountain peaks would break off
Storms overseas forming
It's on the way, maybe a day off
Call it a reborning
Any living thing that could stave off
Surely will be mourning

[Verse 4]
Core snap like yolk, floor crack like joke
More cat eye opens, sky racked like coat
Crust break like bread, dust spread like butter
Forward, get a hoard to make the enemy suffer
Muscle that was forged up in the center of Mother Earth
Utterly formless pours out from the gutters
And bubbles and sputters into a solid and moves quick
Teeth sharp like collar, bone hard like dick
Fuck up all obstacle
Obelisk topple awkward (Down, down, down)
And more thick sounding thunder cracks around the world
With the force to rack brain, pain vice like grip, they all trip
Struggle down, struggle down, struggle down (Struggle down)
Tumble down, tumble down, tumble down (Tumble down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down, then raise up

[Verse 5]
Running through the streets, they don't stop
Cannibal canopy coming to claim the main spot in evolution
Nothing to do with brain, the sane thoughts of sanctioned ideas
The safety's saying drop that shit (Drop that shit)
What's cooler than being cool? (Ice cold)
Freezer got her feeling to bite and those spikes
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down (Up)

[Verse 6]
Falling is the same as jumping is the same as waiting for the fall
That you all say is coming, you know that you gotta make the call
And if you saying something other than it's time to end it all
Then you were playing silly games like there is nothing there to follow
Wallow in the shallow water where they're dying, always calls
Of returning to the birth without the comfort of a wall
Inside a womb in Mother Earth, again she doesn't care, the sprawl
Of bodies lying on the shore and they'll make anyone at fault
If there was anyone to see the water with animals small
Enough for them to let them be to feed on pieces of them all
Whatever's left of all the people once they give up on the raw
'Cause that will be a lovely treat to everybody that's involved
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down (Lay it down)
Keep it down, keep it down, keep it down (Keep it down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down (Go)
Down, down, down, down, down, then raise up

[Chorus]
Something is underneath, the weight's off
Birds in the trees don't sing
As if the mountain peaks would break off
Storms overseas forming
It's on the way, maybe a day off
Call it a reborning
And any living thing that could stave off
Surely will be mourning

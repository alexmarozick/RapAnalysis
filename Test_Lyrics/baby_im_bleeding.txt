Let that shit run
Ah, fuck!
Alright, alright, alright
Shit
(You think you know me)
Ah, fuck!
Peggy, where you been at? Getting all this promo
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show
I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes & Goofy Troop
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass crackers try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when I'm gunning for my masters, nigga
Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!
It's ironic you pressed for a cooking
It's ironic you talk jail time
But you ain't never seen no central booking (yeah)
It's ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher" Wow!
(You ain't real, I'm gonna show you how I really feel)
White boy better put his hands up, I'm ready
And I'm getting Wilder, shoutout to Deontay
Country niggas booming Peggy, I'm the new Beyoncé
Devil on my entrée, cut like Dante
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- (hold up!)
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye?!
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J
When I hit the stage, niggas know it's a payday
Tell your bitch, come here, like I work for Midway, nigga!
(Fuck!)
